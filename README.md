# CUDA Sobel Edge Detection

This project is a simple yet effective example that performs Sobel edge detection on the GPU using NVIDIA CUDA architecture.

## Features

* Generates a 512x512 chessboard-pattern image on the GPU.
* Sobel Gx and Gy kernels are accelerated using `__constant__` memory.
* Computes gradient magnitude per pixel using a 3x3 convolution window.
* Resulting images can be transferred back to the CPU and saved in `.pgm` format.

## Build

```bash
nvcc main.cu -o sobel
```

## Run

```bash
./sobel
```

## Files

* `kaynak_A.pgm` – Input image generated by the GPU
* `sonuc_sobel.pgm` – Sobel edge detection result

This project serves as a compact starting point for those who want to understand GPU parallelism in image processing.
